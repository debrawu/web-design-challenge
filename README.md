# Web Design Challenge 

## Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
<hr>
In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
<br>
## Website Requirements
<br>
The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:
<ul> A landing page containing:
  <li> An explanation of the project. </li>
  <li> Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization. </li>
</ul>
